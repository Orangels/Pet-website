The principle is very simple, in the current popular anchor-based detection algorithms such as Faster R-CNN and FPN, it is necessary to continuously downsample the input image through the backbone network. After 16 times downsampling, the visual information of some small objects in the original image has been kept little, so the training image scale has to be properly upgraded to keep more information for small objects.

When the training batch is multiplied by a multiplr, the learning rate is multiplied by the same multiplr, and all other superparameters remain unchanged. Since FPN, the training process of two-stage object detecter based on Faster R-CNN can achieve best precision when the training batch size is 16 and the learning rate is 0.02. When the training batch changes, the learning rate should also be changed in an equal proportion. The learning rate change strategy can also be applied to instance analysis tasks such as Keyoint R-CNN and Parsing R-CNN.'}
